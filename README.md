# Digital Logic Simulator

The digital logic simulator is a circuit simulator which reads a circuit definition file and an input vector definition file and simulates the operation of the circuit over time (stopping after 60 time steps or until the output no longer changes).  

It can handle simple circuits,

and it can also handle more complex circuits, such as flip-flops.
